# Day 11 - Don´t we all like a discount?

We've got another challenge for you today! This one isn't too easy, but it's going to be fun!

**Challenge:** Head to a store of any kind and ask for a discount on something that isn’t discounted (e.g., a coffee, etc.).

**Tip:** Try picking someone who doesn’t seem too busy, so you don’t distract them from their work and can have a real conversation. And remember, charm works better than pleading when you don't have a solid argument. :)

Kudos to all our savvy savers today! 💸
