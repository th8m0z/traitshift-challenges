# Day 12 - Strengths and Strategies

Today, we want to activate all the strengths and strategies you’ve collected over the past two weeks. We’ll do this by creating a Resource Tree!

### What’s a Resource Tree?

Think of a Resource Tree as a visual representation of your social strengths, support systems, goals, and tools. It’s a fun and creative way to visualize all the awesome resources you have at your disposal. It's especially helpful to revisit in moments when you don't feel confident about achieving your change goals.

### Steps to Create Your Resource Tree:

1. **Prepare Your Materials:**
    
    Grab a blank page. It’s probably easier to draw it with pen and paper, but if you prefer a digital version, you can just add bullet points under the following steps.
    
2. **Draw Your Tree:**
    
    **Roots (Foundational Social Skills and Strengths):**
    
    - What are your inherent social strengths? (e.g., friendliness, good listening skills). *Recall the strengths you identified on Day 1.*
    
    **Trunk (Core Support Systems):**
    
    - Who supports you in your social endeavors? This could be mentors, family, or close friends. *Remember the conversation you had with that friend of yours?*
    
    **Branches (Goals):**
    
    - What specific social goals do you have? Break them down into immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals. *Think back to the benefits of being extraverted that you listed on Day 2.*
    
    **Leaves (Tools and Resources):**
    
    - List any strategies, phrases, questions, etc., that could help in social interactions. *For example, recall the three points from the video on Day 8.*

Here’s an example of what your tree might look like:

```
Roots:
- Friendliness
- Good listening skills

Trunk:
- Supportive family
- Encouraging mentor
- Close friend [specific conversation]

Branches:
- Immediate: Start a conversation with a colleague
- Intermediate: Join a social club
- Long-term: Develop public speaking skills

Leaves:
- Use open-ended questions
- Smile and maintain eye contact
- Reflect on positive interactions

```

The more time you invest, the bigger and stronger your tree will grow. And so will your extraversion! Keep your sheet or file so you can add new insights and resources whenever they come to mind!

Enjoy the rest of your day! 💚
