# Day 7 - Social Anxiety

Start today by taking a moment to reflect on how easy it was to envision being more extraverted yesterday. We know that real change doesn't happen in a miraculous way over night, so let's keep working towards our goals together. Our challenge for today: 

While extraversion has its fun, sociable side, it also comes with its own set of challenges, what is often referred to as social anxiety nowadays. Whether or not you identify with this, today's task will help you navigate any struggles you might have with being more sociable.  A tiny piece of information first:

*Social anxiety is a common condition where individuals feel intense nervousness and fear about social interactions. It's characterized by a fear of being judged or negatively evaluated by others, leading to avoidance of social situations. This anxiety can significantly impair daily functioning and quality of life. To address these challenges, techniques like cognitive reframing are vital. Reframing helps by identifying and modifying negative, dysfunctional thoughts associated with social situations, empowering individuals to engage more confidently and reduce anxiety. This technique is not just about managing symptoms but also about enhancing overall social interaction and personal growth.*

Today we start by identifying all the negative, unhelpful thoughts that are linked to your challenges with social interactions. We have already collected some of those thoughts in a few of the earlier challenges, so it might help to have a look at your notes.

Choose the negative thought that burdens you the most and question it by answering the following questions:

1. What is the evidence for this thought? Against it?
2. Am I basing thoughts on facts, or on feelings?
3. Is this thought black and white, when reality in fact is more complicated?
4. Could I be misinterpreting the evidence? Am I making any assumptions?
5. Am I looking at all the evidence or just what supports the thought? Could my thought be an exaggeration of what´s true?
6. Is my thought a likely scenario, or is it the worst case scenario?

Now turn each negative thought into a positive statement that reflects reality and your ability to handle situations. For instance, change "I can't do this" to "I can handle this challenge with effort and strategy." Make sure your affirmations are believable and relate directly to the negative thoughts you are addressing. Vague or overly ambitious affirmations may feel insincere and be less effective. You can repeat this process, with other negative thoughts, whenever u feel like it!

One last thing before you leave: pick a friend that you haven't spoken to for more than a month and arrange a call/meeting with them for tomorrow.
