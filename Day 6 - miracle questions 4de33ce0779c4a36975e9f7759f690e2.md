# Day 6 - miracle questions

After identifying the gap between your current level of extraversion and your aspired goal yesterday, this technique will help us envision your desired personality and future. Imagine this scenario:

“Suppose tonight, while you sleep, a miracle happens and you transform into the most extraverted and sociable version of yourself. You wake up feeling a newfound sense of confidence, effortlessly engaging in lively conversations, making new friends with ease, and thriving in social settings. Your charisma shines through in both personal and professional interactions, leading to deeper connections and a more fulfilling social life.”

Now, take 5 minutes to jot down your answers to the following questions in your notebook or note-taking app. Be as specific as possible:

1. What will be the first thing you do when you wake up after the miracle has occurred?
2. What everyday problems are solved? (*Think about social interactions at university, work, or in public)*
3. Additionally, think of a topic you wouldn't typically discuss with colleagues or friends but would feel comfortable tackling as your more sociable self.

You know what's coming next… For today or tomorrow, have a 5-minute conversation with a friend or colleague about that topic! 💚

💡 **Tip:** To help you successfully complete those tasks, psychologists use a technique called *implementation intentions*. This involves thinking about a specific scenario in which you want to perform the desired behavior and planning it in an "if-then" format. For example, "If I am having lunch with a colleague, then I will bring up the topic I usually avoid." This way, you have a clear plan that connects a specific situation with a specific action.
