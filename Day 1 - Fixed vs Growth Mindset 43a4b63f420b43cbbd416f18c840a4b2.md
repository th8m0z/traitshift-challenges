# Day 1 - Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

Hey!

Welcome to Day One of your sociability improvement program. We’re thrilled to have you join us on this journey towards a more fulfilling life.

Today, we’re laying a solid foundation by addressing some key beliefs. Your beliefs shape your actions and personality, so it's important to clear up common misconceptions.

To get started, please read this article: [**Carol Dweck: A Summary of Growth and Fixed Mindsets**](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/). It takes less than 10 minutes and provides valuable insights into what constitutes a healthy mindset in all areas of life.

Finished reading? Great! Now, let’s apply what you’ve learned to your life.

- Knowing what you know now, how do you feel about your current level of extraversion?
- In what situations would people label you as extraverted?
- In what situations would people label you as introverted?
- In what situations are you comfortable or uncomfortable with your current behavior?

Remember, extraversion is not a fixed trait. How could you adjust your behavior to be more extraverted?

Let these thoughts simmer a bit, and keep in mind that extraversion is based on your daily behaviors, not on an unchangeable genetic blueprint.

We hope you enjoyed today's exercise. See you this evening for a quick questionnaire about your experience today!
