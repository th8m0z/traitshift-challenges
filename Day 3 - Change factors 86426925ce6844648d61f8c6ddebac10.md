# Day 3 - Change factors

We're thrilled to see you continuing your journey! Every day you stick with your challenge brings you closer to achieving your goals. 💚

Have you ever wondered if personality change programs like this actually work? If you have, that's a fantastic question! Critical thinking is key to learning and developing new insights. We've considered this too, which is why we want to share the science behind our approach. Studies have shown that similar programs can successfully create significant and long-lasting changes in personality traits *(Stieger et al., 2021)*. 

Here are some key factors scientists have identified as crucial for change:

- **Identifying your strengths and resources:** Knowing what you're good at empowers you to make changes.
- **Understanding the gap:** Recognizing the difference between your current level and your desired level of a personality trait helps you focus your efforts.
- **Behavioral activation:** Consistently practicing behaviors that align with your desired trait helps them become habits.
- **Reflection and Feedback:** Regularly reflecting on your progress allows you to track your success and adjust your approach as needed.
- **You have to follow through:** As with most things in life, your results will depend on the dedication and effort you put in.

Now, let's get practical! We want you to brainstorm three social actions you can incorporate into your daily routine. For each one, make a plan by considering when and where you'll do it tomorrow.  Also, anticipate potential obstacles and brainstorm ways to overcome them.

Feeling stuck on ideas? Don't worry, we have some suggestions to spark your creativity. But remember, it's always best to come up with your own ideas or tailor them to your specific lifestyle for a better fit.

Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- **Spark a conversation:** Strike up a friendly chat with someone new at the coffee shop, bus stop, or anywhere else you encounter someone.
- **Compliment someone:** Make someone's day with a genuine compliment on their outfit, smile, or accomplishment.
- **Join a group activity:** Sign up for a class, club, or volunteer opportunity related to your hobbies. This is a fantastic way to connect with people who share your interests!
- **Take the initiative:** Tired of waiting for invitations? Be the one to suggest plans with friends, colleagues, or even acquaintances!
